# Sharp Crokite

## Introduction
This tool assists players by offering quick access to handy overviews, aggregations and calculations, all based on up-to-date in-game information gathered from various web resources.

I started this project because I have built multiple complicated spreadsheets for the game, which I all aim to replace with this tool. It's a hobby project to tinker with in my spare time, while also serving as a display of my abilities and knowledge.

## Running the application
It's as simple as building the solution and running the application. It will create the database for you. Then, use the button `Update Static Data` followed by `Update Prices` to populate the database with the latest data.
